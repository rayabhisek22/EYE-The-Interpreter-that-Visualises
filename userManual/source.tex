\section{Introduction}
Our language is very similar to C++ with some in-built data structures like stacks, queues, and others mentioned below. It has most of the implementations of C++ except classes. Given below are some of the rules of the language.
\section{General Rules}
\begin{itemize}
\item Every statement has a semicolon at its end
\item The language is not whitespace sensitive
\item The main program begins with a main-program tag
\item All the control flow statements have to come within a {} bracket
\end{itemize}
\section{Declarations}
The declarations are exactly similar to C++. The type of the variable to be declared is followed by the names of the variables separated which can be given a value eg $int\ a=10,b=5,c;$. 
 The primitive datatypes are
\begin{itemize}
\item bool
\item int
\item float
\item string
\end{itemize}
The arrays can also be initialized by mentioning the type.
eg. int a[10];
\section{Assignment}
The name of a variable can be written in any expression(in the rhs of an assignment) and the value of the variable at that point is substituted.
The expression can be parenthesised or not, it will be implemented using the rules of BODMAS.The LHS of an assignment has to be a variable that is already initialized.eg. a=x*y-3.
The algebraic and boolean operators are similar to C++, with only the ++ construct not defined. The arrays can be accesed similarly.
\section{Functions}
The functions are exactly similar to C++, but everything is passed by value and arrays cannot be passed as arguments.
\begin{itemize}
\item The function has to have a return statement or it should be of the type void.
\item The function can be called at the RHS of an assignment if it has a non-void return type
\item Else it can be called just as a statement
\item Global variables have been defined too. Their value can be changed anywhere in the program
\item Normal rules of scoping and blocks have been followed.
\end{itemize}
\section{Control-flow}
\begin{itemize}
\item If-Elseif-else statements-They are implemented as in C++. The block of every condition should be inside a {} bracket
\item The for-loops and while-loop have been implemented with their usual meaning in C++.
\end{itemize}
\section{Data Structures}
We have defined several of the common data structures used by programmers and we go on to explain how to declare instances of these data structures and the member functions that it contains.
\subsection{Stack}
This declares the data structure called stack, which is basically a first-in-first-out or FIFO kind of data structure. To define it use the following signature:
\begin{verbatim}
    stack<dataType> StackName
\end{verbatim}
where dataType can refer to int, float, string, etc.
The member functions include functions to access the top element of the stack, check the size, check if it is empty, insert to the stack and pop the top element.
\begin{verbatim}
    myStack.push(10) //pushes 10 to the top of the stack
    myStack.pop() //pops the top element of the stack
    myStack.top() //returns the top element of the stack
    myStack.empty() //returns true if the stack is empty
    myStack.size() //returns the number of elements in the stack
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Queue}
This data structure is a first in last out or LIFO queue. It is a double sided queue, that is, you can push and pop from and to both ends of the queue.
The declaration is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    queue<float>q;
\end{verbatim}
The member functions are as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    q.pushFront(0.3) //push to the front of the queue
    q.popFront() //pop the element at the front of the queue
    q.pushBack(0.3) //push to the back of the queue
    q.popBack() //pop from the back of the queue
    q.empty() //return true if the queue is empty
    q.size() //return the size of the queue
    q.front() //return the element at the front of the queue
    q.back() //return the element at the back of the queue
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Binary Search Tree}
We have implemented a binary search tree which allows insertion, deletion and finding operations in logarithmic time.
\\
The declaration is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    binarySearchTree<double>bst;
\end{verbatim}
The member functions for searching, insertion and deletion are as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    bst.insert(2.3) //insert an element into the binary tree
    bst.find(2.4) //return true if the element is in the binary tree
    bst.delete(2) // deletes the element if it is found in the tree
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Linked List}
This implements a singly linked list which is declared as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    linkedList<long long int> ll;
\end{verbatim}
This supports functions like inserting an element at an index, searching for an element, deleting an element and returning the index of an element.
\begin{verbatim}
    ll.insert(10, 12000) //inserts 12000 at index 10
    ll.indexOf(12000) //returns the index at which an element is present
    ll.erase(10000) //erase an element from the list
    ll.find(100) //returns true if an element is found
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Hash Table}
This implements a hashing table which using open hashing and uses a hash function that uses the remainder function. It is similar to the unordered set of the C++ STL. The declaration is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    hashTable<int>ht(29) // where 29 is the divisor we want to use
\end{verbatim}
It supports the functions of push, erase and find. We use them as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    ht.push(12) // insert 12 into the hash table
    ht.find(12) //return true if 12 is in the hash table
    ht.erase(13) // erase 13 if it is present in the hash table 
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Doubly Linked List}
This implements a doubly linked list which is declared as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    doublyLinkedList<long long int> dl;
\end{verbatim}
This supports functions like inserting an element at an index, searching for an element, deleting an element and returning the index of an element.
\begin{verbatim}
    dl.insert(10, 12000) //inserts 12000 at index 10
    dl.indexOf(12000) //returns the index at which an element is present
    dl.erase(10000) //erase an element from the list
    dl.find(100) //returns true if an element is found
\end{verbatim}
