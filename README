We have deleted the .git folder as it was 40 MB and adding it caused the file size to exceed the limit on moodle

One can find the instructions for installing the libraries we need and how to run the code in the user manual in the userManual directory.

THE DIRECTORY STRUCTURE IS AS FOLLOWS

The userManual directory contains the user manual with all necessary information for our platform.

The html directory contains the documentation that was generated by doxygen

the report direcory contains the project report and the slides.

the miscellaneous directory contains other files we have used during the course of the project including some bash scripts.

We have documented the code well and we have divided it into folders as well which represent one module each. We have the parser directory that contains the two files - parsingClasses - which defines the classes we use to store each of the programming constructs and parsingRules - which defines all the rules for parsing. The directory called lexer contains the rules for lexing the user code. The dataStructures directory contains the graphics library we used and our implementations of all the data structures, execution stack, etc.
